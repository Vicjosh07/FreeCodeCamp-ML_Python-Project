# FCC Machine Learning Collection

**Hands-on ML projects**, guided by the freeCodeCamp “Machine Learning with Python” curriculum, bundled in one repo. Freshly certified, and ready to show how I learned—by building.

##  Projects Overview

| Project | Description | Key Skills |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Rock-Paper-Scissors AI** | Build an algorithm to beat various opponents at least 60% of the time using Python logic. (Includes implementing counter Markov Chains to outthink “Abbey.”)  | Algorithmic thinking • Logical deductions • Game strategy |
| **Cat & Dog Image Classifier** | Train a CNN (Keras or PyTorch) to tell cats from dogs—classic computer vision warmed up by FCC.  | CNN architecture • Data preprocessing • Model evaluation |
| **Book Recommendation Engine (KNN)** | Use K-nearest neighbors on user-rating data to suggest books. Cleaned, filtered, and metric-tweaked for relevancy.  | KNN • Recommendation logic • Data filtering |
| **Health Costs Linear Regression** | Predict medical expenses using linear regression—basic model tuning and feature handling.  | Regression modeling • Cost prediction • Feature engineering |
| **SMS Text Classifier** | Spot spam texts via a neural network—vectorized inputs, training, validation, and accuracy checks. | NLP processing • Neural nets • Text classification |
